    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>
        We received a request to reset the password for your {companyDisplayName} account. If you made this request,
        please click the button below to reset your password:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="{passwordResetLink}" class="button">Reset Password</a>
    </p>
    <p>If the button above doesn't work, you can also copy and paste the following link into your browser:</p>
    <p>{passwordResetLink}</p>
    <p><strong>Important Security Information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>This password reset link is valid for {linkLifespan}. After that, you'll need to request a new one.</li>
        <li>
            If you didn't request a password reset, it's possible someone else entered your email address by mistake.
            In that case, you can safely ignore this email—no changes will be made to your account.
        </li>
        <li>For your security, after resetting your password, please make sure it is unique and not reused across multiple sites.</li>
        <li>
            If you suspect any unusual activity on your account,
            we recommend changing your password and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) if you haven't already.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact us immediately at {supportEmailAddress}.</p>
    <p>Thank you,<br>{companyDisplayName} Team</p>
